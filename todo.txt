UI
    fix switching from free-roam to non-free-roam
    make RAY_EPSILON and MAX_RADIANCE adjustable
pathtracer
    add RAY_EPSILON and MAX_RADIANCE to override constants (or push constants?)

    ray queries
    denoising (oidn)
loader
    improve json parser
    make all scenes loadable ------- IMPORTANT

    would be cool:
        - asynchronous loading with progress bar
        - parallel loading of textures

misc
    figure out the purpose of the emission direction check in yocto (yocto_cutrace.cu, line 380)
    fix warnings
    just use eframe instead of winit, which has breaking changes on every version

    maybe use software rendering for the UI and put it in another thread (maybe...).
