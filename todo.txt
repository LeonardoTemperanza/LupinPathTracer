UI
    fix switching from free-roam to non-free-roam
    make RAY_EPSILON and MAX_RADIANCE adjustable
pathtracer
    add RAY_EPSILON and MAX_RADIANCE to override constants (or push constants?)

    improve json parser

    would be cool:
        - asynchronous loading with progress bar
        - parallel loading of textures

misc
    figure out the purpose of the emission direction check in yocto (yocto_cutrace.cu, line 380)
    fix warnings
